  <p><strong>Colonel Jim Burns, OC, CD - Honorary Colonel</strong>
   </p>
<img src="../images/burns_bio.jpg" alt="Honorary Colonel James W. Burns" width="500" height="121" /></center>
<p>Honorary Colonel James W. Burns, O.C., C.D., LL.D. was born and raised in Winnipeg.&nbsp; After graduation from Gordon Bell High School he entered the University of Manitoba earning a Bachelor&rsquo;s of Commerce in 1951.&nbsp; He joined The Great-West Life Assurance Company in 1953 after achieving an MBA from Harvard University.&nbsp; He rose steadily through the ranks and was named President in 1971 and then became Chairman in 1979 when he was appointed President of Power Corporation.&nbsp; In 1986 he was appointed Deputy Chairman of Power Corporation and Chairman of Power Financial Corporation.&nbsp; He stepped down from Power Financial&rsquo;s Chairmanship in 1990 but remained Deputy Chairman of Power until his retirement in 2002.&nbsp; He remains a Director Emeritus of both these Corporations today.&nbsp; He also relinquished the Chairmanship of Great-West Life in 2002 having seen the Corporation through a period of incredible growth, which included the acquisitions of London Life and Canada Life.</p>
<p>A noted philanthropist, Colonel Burns has given time as well as money locally.&nbsp; A founding director of the Manitoba Centennial Corporation and the Manitoba Museum, he is a Director of Centre Venture Development Corporation and a driving force on the Board of Cancer Care Manitoba Foundation.&nbsp; Nationally he has chaired the Conference Board of Canada, served on the Board of Canadian Council for Business and the Arts and was a member of the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Executive Compensation in Government for fourteen years.</p>
<p>In 1978 he was awarded the Alumni Jubilee Award by the University of Manitoba.&nbsp; The University has further honoured him in 1987 when he was awarded the degree of LL.D (<em>honouris causa</em>) and again in 2000 with the Peter D. Curry Chancellor&rsquo;s Award.&nbsp; In recognition of the great contribution he has made to this country, Colonel Burns was appointed an Officer in the Order of Canada in 1988.&nbsp; In 2005 the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Society of Winnipeg recognized his exemplary service to the public by presenting him their Citizen of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Colonel Burns began his association with the Camerons in 1978, accepting the appointment of Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel.&nbsp; In 1993 he assumed the appointment of Honorary Colonel.&nbsp; Throughout the uncertainty of the late 90s when Reserve Restructure loomed over the Regiment like a sword of Damocles, Colonel Burns led the fight to shield the Camerons from being reorganized out of existence, bringing all his political and personal influence to bear both in Ottawa and here locally.&nbsp; Needless to say we&rsquo;re still here.</p>
Colonel Burns and his late wife Barbara have three children: James and Martha living in the Toronto area and Allan in Vancouver.&nbsp; With the exception of twelve years in Montreal, Colonel Burns has resided in Winnipeg his entire life.
